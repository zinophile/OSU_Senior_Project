# osu_seniorproject
Senior Project

To Test:

Go to : http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~kurakuls/seniorproject/login.php

LOGIN: kurakuls+admin2@oregonstate.edu
PASSWORD: testing


That is an admin username and password. You can then add your own user with the format:

{OSUUSERNAME}+{OPTIONAL VALUE}@oregonstate.edu

This will send you an email with the activation page and key. From there you can activate your own account and log in that way.

I would suggest making your first account an admin to have privileges to create normal users and other admin accounts.

You can use as many {OPTIONAL VALUE}'s as you want to create multiple accounts for testing.

You are more than welcome to continue using kurakuls+admin2@oregonstate.edu / testing as the admin testing account.



If you wish to deploy this on your system. You will also have to run composer and install the required vendor libraries
